# livephotos
The photos we’ve captured together are more than just digital files or ink on paper; they are the anchors of our shared history. Each image holds a specific warmth, a frozen fragment of time where laughter was loud and the world felt perfectly in sync. When I look at them, I don’t just see faces; I see the evolution of our bond.
